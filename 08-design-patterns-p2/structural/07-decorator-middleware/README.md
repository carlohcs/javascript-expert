## Decorator / Middleware / Injector

> The concept of a decorator is that it adds additional attributes to an object dynamically. A real world example of this would be a picture frame. The picture is our object, which has it's own characteristics. For display purposes we add a frame to the picture, in order to decorate it. You're probably already familiar with the concept of wrapper objects, and in essence, that is what a Decorator is. 

> In this example, we are intercepting and "decorating" a middleware function to add a header in all needed requests.
