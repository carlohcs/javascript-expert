## Template Method

> The Template Method pattern is used when two or more implementations of a similar algorithm exist. In the real world templates are used all the time: for architectural plans, and throughout the engineering domain. A template plan may be defined which is then built on with further variations. For example, a basic house plan can have many variations such as adding an extensions or using a different heating system.
